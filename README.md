# Leetcode Practice
Created this repository as practice for coding in Rust using [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/) problems.

## WIP Problem
* 2021/02/13: [Problem 3](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/) (0003_longest_substring)

## Solved Problems
* 2020/12/19: [Problem 54](https://leetcode.com/problems/spiral-matrix/) (0054_spiral_matrix)
* 2021/02/02: [Problem 1](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/) (0001_two_sum)
* 2021/02/13: [Problem 2](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/) (0002_add_two_numbers)

## Backlog for Refactoring
* Problem 2 needs to be optimized.

## Creating Projects
Cargo syntax for creating projects that begin with numeric values. This is because crates cannot begin with numeric values by convention.

```bash
cargo new 0054_spiral_matrix --name spiral_matrix
cargo new 0001_two_sum --name two_sum
cargo new 0002_add_two_numbers --name add_two_numbers
cargo new 0003_longest_substring --name longest_substring
```
